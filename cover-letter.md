Hello, Hiring Team!

I am writing to express my interest in the open position, bringing 20+ years of experience with a sharp focus on Java and engineering excellence. My expertise spans agile process, developer experience, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes/Docker orchestration, automated testing, and software development best practices. In recent years, I have been focusing on developer experience, improving developer productivity, advocating for automation, and implementing solutions that have saved thousands of developer-hours. 

As a hands-on Java developer and technical leader, I've architected solutions using Spring Framework, built RESTful APIs serving millions of requests, and optimized JVM performance for high-throughput applications. My DevOps background complements my development skills perfectly — I've containerized Java applications with Docker, orchestrated deployments on Kubernetes, manage builds with GitHub Actions or GitLab, and implemented comprehensive testing strategies including JUnit, Mockito, and integration testing that caught critical issues before production. While Java is my primary focus, I consider myself a polyglot developer, also comfortable with NodeJS, TypeScript, and shell scripting. 

What sets me apart is my ability to elevate entire engineering practices while staying deeply technical. As a consultant in the Seattle area, I've helped companies modernize their Java applications, implement proper dependency management patterns, establish code quality gates with SonarQube, and migrate legacy monoliths to cloud-native microservices. I'm comfortable presenting technical solutions to C-level executives and mentoring junior developers on Java best practices.

I've been an early adopter of tools that are now industry standard -— implementing continuous integration before Jenkins gained popularity, building feature flag systems from scratch, and integrating security scanning into Java build pipelines years before it became commonplace. Today, I'm equally passionate about leveraging AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude/Sonnet to accelerate development while maintaining code quality and security standards.

I believe that my skills and experience make me a great fit for this role, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my expertise to your team. I am confident that my passion for improving software development practices, along with my diverse skill set, will enable me to make a significant impact in this position.

Thank you for considering me. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can fit your team's needs.
